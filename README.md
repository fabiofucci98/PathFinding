# PathFinding
Simple application to show some pathfinding algorithms

All python, tkinter for GUI.
Implemented algos: naive, BFS, DFS, iterative deepening, uniform cost search, A*
Water nodes are used to represent zones that are "harder" to traverse, therefore A* and uniform cost search are going to avoid them.
